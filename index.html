    <h1>Computer Science vs. Computer Engineering</h1>
    <p>
      While these computer science and computer engineering degrees share similar courses and are both great choices for a strong technology career,  there is a major difference to note. Computer science focuses mostly on troubleshooting issues on a software level. Expect to learn different programming languages, how to work with operating systems, and how to maintain databases.
      Computer engineering focuses on solving problems and designing hardware and software interfaces. Expect some similarities between the degrees and job titles, since computer engineers can be responsible for the development and prototyping of software and hardware simultaneously.</p>
